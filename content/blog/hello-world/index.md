Hi and welcome to my blog! My name is **William Seward** and I'm a software engineer.

Here I'll be writing about things I find interesting and helpful (and hope you will like them too). I'm passionate about all things software, love to learn, and genuinely enjoy helping others by sharing what I know.

For my inaugural post I'd like to share this inspiring quote from the marvelous [Kent Beck](https://www.kentbeck.com/):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the *craft* of programming begins with empathy, not formatting or languages or tools or algorithms or data structures</p>&mdash; Kent Beck (@KentBeck) <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/566255102067871744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2015</a></blockquote>

My first _actual_ post is already up and it's about why [Your Standups Probably Suck](/your-standups-probably-suck/). I hope you enjoy!
